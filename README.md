# Automated-Stage
This is a matlab code for the developement of automated stage inorder to carry out the measurements on a silicon nanophotonics chip.
Any questions or comments can be directed to the author.

The software is mainly written in matlab. However, we have used some of the drivers from CT-400 and edited it according to our usage.

Hardware required: 
Yennista Laser 
Yennista CT-400
Corvus Eco Microcontroller
Translation stage connected to a stepper motors.

The software is very robust and reliable in terms of measurements.

Thanks!
